## 🧰 Configuration

This project uses the following configuration files:

- **`tsconfig.json`** – TypeScript configuration, strict mode enabled, supports path aliases (`@/*`), and is set up for Next.js 14.
- **`postcss.config.mjs`** – PostCSS configuration with Tailwind CSS plugin enabled.
- **`tailwind.config.ts`** – Tailwind CSS configuration with custom theme settings.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is enabled with strict settings for better type safety. Path aliases are configured so you can import modules using `@/` as the root of the project directory.

### PostCSS & Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is integrated via PostCSS. You can customize your styles in the `app/globals.css` file and extend the theme in `tailwind.config.ts`.
